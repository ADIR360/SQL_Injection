Disclaimer:

This README file is intended for educational purposes ONLY. The information provided here should NOT be used to exploit systems or harm others. SQL and Command Injection are serious vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to systems and data. Using these techniques without proper authorization is illegal and unethical.

If you choose to proceed with this assignment, it is crucial to understand the potential consequences of your actions. You should only perform these exercises in a controlled environment where you have explicit permission to do so.

Steps to Execute SQL and Command Injection:

Note: These steps are provided for educational purposes only. Please use them responsibly and ethically.

SQL Injection:

Identify Vulnerable Input Fields: Look for web applications that accept user-supplied input, such as search boxes, login forms, or registration forms.
Construct Malicious Input: Create input that includes SQL syntax, such as single quotes ('), double quotes ("), semicolons (;), or special characters.
Test with Different Input: Try various combinations of malicious input to identify potential vulnerabilities.
Analyze the Output: Observe the application's response to determine if the injected SQL code was executed.
Example:

If a website has a search box that accepts user input, you might try entering the following:

SQL
' OR 1=1 --
Use code with caution.

This input attempts to bypass the original query and always return results.

Command Injection:

Identify Vulnerable Input Fields: Look for web applications that accept user-supplied input that is passed to an operating system command.
Construct Malicious Input: Create input that includes operating system commands, such as ls, cat, or pwd.
Test with Different Input: Try various combinations of malicious input to identify potential vulnerabilities.
Analyze the Output: Observe the application's response to determine if the injected command was executed.
Example:

If a website allows users to upload files with custom filenames, you might try uploading a file named:

image.jpg; ls
This input attempts to execute the ls command after the file upload.

Additional Considerations:

Use a virtual environment or isolated testing platform to practice these techniques safely.
Never attempt to exploit vulnerabilities on production systems or systems that you do not own.
Always respect the privacy and security of others.
Stay informed about the latest security best practices to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced into your own applications.
Again, it is essential to emphasize that SQL and Command Injection are serious security risks. Use this information responsibly and ethically.
